# investigate_a_dataset
Udacity_Project

This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question
of whether or not patients show up for their appointment and Why do 30% of patients miss their scheduled appointments?

In this project, I analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it using jupyter notebook.

I do the whole process gathering data, cleaning it and exploring it by making some visualizations that helping me to answer the business questions.
